# Specification Quality Checklist: Consent per Site for Embedded Frames

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-11-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The tool names (`read_page`, `find`, `propose_sites`, `form_input`, `evaluate`) and "debugger access" are
  the product's own user-facing terms and existing constraints, kept as this repository's specs do. They
  are not new technology choices.
- The facts section records how the code behaves today (read 2026-11-07); requirements say only what must
  hold.
